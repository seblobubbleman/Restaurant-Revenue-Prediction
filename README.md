# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction  Project Overview 
* Created a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites.
* Explored categorical and numerical relationship to revenue using graphical models. 
* Conducted feature engineering on the data to help best predict the model. 
* Used Linear, Lasso, KNeighbors, and Support Vector Regression to predict revenue.
* Choose Support Vector Regression as model.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7
**Packages:** numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime

## Exploratory Data Analysis
* I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various variables. Below are a few highlights from the tables.
